# EEG-data-analysis-
Worked on Dr. M Roncaglia RITA electroencephalogram (EEG) brain activity dataset. Preprocessed, cleaned and transformed the brain activity data to be used for monitoring and measuring distinct brain frequencies.

This project includes converting oscilatory activity to a time frequency analysis to examine brain frequency behavior, setting up a fourier transformation to convert the frequencies into a signal that can be represented through time, and looking for oscillator activity with regards to an event related potential.

The goal of this project is  to look for consistent EEG  power  fluctuations  in  one  or  more  frequency  bands in  relation to the onset of a critical item in the sentences(ERP).
